# SMART-TRUCK-
This project integrates RFID-based access control with motorized truck operation using an LCD display and buzzer feedback. When an authorized card is scanned, the truck is activated for a set duration, and the driver's details are displayed. It includes individual card verification for multiple users, displaying their names on the LCD screen.

Key Components:

    MFRC522 RFID Module
    LCD I2C Display
    Motor Control for Truck Operation
    Buzzer for Feedback
    RFID-based User Authentication

This system simulates a smart access control for trucks, verifying license cards before allowing operation.
