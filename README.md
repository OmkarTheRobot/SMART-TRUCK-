# SMART-TRUCK-
This project integrates RFID-based access control with motorized truck operation using an LCD display and buzzer feedback. When an authorized card is scanned, the truck is activated for a set duration, and the driver's details are displayed. It includes individual card verification for multiple users, displaying their names on the LCD screen.
